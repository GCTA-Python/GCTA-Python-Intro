    "A loop, or iteration, can be thought of as the process of repeating a block of code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "loop 2:\n",
    "    do thing 1\n",
    "    do thing 2\n",
    "    do thing 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this generic example (<code>loop</code> is not valid Python syntax), we have a loop statement <code>loop 2:</code>, and a code-block (here, three lines of code). Each of these lines of code (<code>do thing 1</code>, <code>do thing 2</code>, and <code>do thing 3</code>) are executed each time we loop (in other words, each time we iterate). The example above is a loop that iterates (or loops) twice, with each iteration executing these three lines of code (the loop's code-block).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Walking through the execution of this loop: we start at the line immediately below the loop statement, <code>do thing 1</code>; we first execute <code>do thing 1</code>, then execute <code>do thing 2</code>, and lastly execute <code>do thing 3</code>; because our loop iterates twice, we do not go to the next line below <code>do thing 3</code>, instead, we immediately go back to <code>do thing 1</code> and repeat the process. This generic example loop only repeats twice, so, after the second time we've reached <code>do thing 3</code>, we move to the next line of code below <code>do thing 3</code>.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is important to understand that the number of iterations the loop has determines the number of times we execute the block of code belonging to the loop (e.g. if our loop iterated 5 times, we would execute this block of code 5 times).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>For-Loop Introduction and Syntax</h2>\n",
    "For-loops take a collection of objects (an <b>iterable object</b>, or the <b>iterator</b>), and expose each object in the collection to the for-loop's code-block by assigning each object, in sequential order (left to right), to the <b>iterator variable</b>. For-loops utilize the keywords <code>for</code> and <code>in</code>, in the form of <code>for iterator_variable in iterator:</code> (don't forget the colon!).\n",

    "The <code>iterator_variable</code>, as the name suggests, is a variable. This variable must be named by the person writing the for-loop, and follows the same naming rules we've previously learned (alphanumeric, no spaces, no leading numbers, no keywords). The <code>iterator</code> is an <b>iterable object</b> (or an assigned variable name), or a collection of objects we can use to iterate (or loop) over.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The specific object the iterator variable represents is determined by the number of iterations we've completed. The first iteration corresponds to the first object in the collection of objects (leftmost), with the second object on the second iteration, the third object on the third iteration, and so forth. The last object assigned to the iterator variable will be the rightmost object in the collection of objects. While iterator variables are assigned object values from our collection of objects, their use within the for-loop's code block is not required.\n",
