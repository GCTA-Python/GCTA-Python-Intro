    "\n",
    "This course serves dual purposes: Foremost, (1) to develop entry level proficiency with the Python programing language, through individualized tutoring and heavily augmenting the Python Institute's Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer curriculum; and secondarily (an optional addition to the 10-week curriculum) (2), realize your maximum coding potential beyond the standard 10-week curriculum, which varies from student to student, but may include personal projects, portfolios, etc.. It is important to understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being interested in only obtaining the certification, and for those students, we will be working on that for the entire 10 weeks.\n",
