pseudo code and problem solving practice


write a variable that represents a real world boolean status
i.e. whether something is true or false
for example: whether I have an object, or not.
             whether an object has a property, or not.
             whether I have items in a container, or not.
             are you in class today, or not?
 
# problem 0.1
write a script that requests user input and assigns it to a variable

# problem 0.2
write real world examples of user input for bool, float, int, and str


# problem 1.1
I have four burgers. (or user input)
But I have zero milkshakes.
If I have more than 2 burgers, Ron will give me a milkshake.
keep track of the total number of items I have...
and then send to std out (print) that total.

# pseudocode
# record burgers
# record milkshakes
# if more than 2 burgers, +1 milkshake
# sum burgers and milkshakes
# print sum

# code
burgers = 4
milkshakes = 0

if burgers > 2:
    milkshakes = milkshakes + 1
    
burger_shakes = burgers + milkshakes

print(burger_shakes)



# problem 1.2
I have four burgers. (or user input)
But I have zero milkshakes.
If I have more than 2 burgers, Ron will give me a milkshake.
And if I have more than 3 items, I will have to put all of the items into a bag.
keep track of the total number of items I have...
and whether or not the items are bagged.
and then send to std out (print) that total and bagged status.

# record burgers
# record milkshakes
# initalize bagged status
# if more than 2 burgers, +1 milkshake
# sum burgers and milkshakes
# if sum > 3, bagged status is true
# print sum and bagged status


# code
burgers = 4
milkshakes = 0
bagged = False

if burgers > 2:
    milkshakes = milkshakes + 1
    
burger_shakes = burgers + milkshakes

if burger_shakes > 4:
    bagged = True

print(burger_shakes, bagged)



# problem 2.1
I have a user defined number of burgers.
I have 1 milkshakes.

If I have 1 burger, Ron will give me 1 milkshake.
If I have more than 1 burger, but less than three burgers, Ron will give me 1 toy.
If I have 3 or more burgers, Ron gives me 1 toy and 2 milkshakes

keep track of items I have
and then send to std out (print) the items and how many I have

# request user-burger input
# record milkshakes
# record toys
# if 1 burger, +1 milkshake
# if 2 burgers, +1 toy
# if 3 burgers, +1 toy +2 milkshakes
# print items


# code
burgers = int(input('burger number'))
milkshakes = 1
toys = 0

if burgers == 1:
    milkshakes = milkshakes + 1
elif burgers >= 1 and burgers < 3:
    toys = toys + 1
else:  # burgers > 3
    toys = toys + 1
    milkshakes = milkshakes + 2

print(burgers, milkshakes, toys)
print('burgers:', burgers, 'milkshakes:', milkshakes, 'toys', toys)


# user input check
burgers = 0
while burgers < 0:
    burgers = int(input('burger number')
